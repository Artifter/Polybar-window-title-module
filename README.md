# Polybar-window-title-module

This is a simple module for polybar aiming to display active window name

move xgetfocus.sh to ~/.config/polybar/scripts and everything should work nicely

It was tested on i3gaps, if you want less processor usage just change the interval parameter to a higher value

Hope you have fun with this!
