# Polybar-window-title-module

#This is a simple module for polybar aiming to display active window name
#move xgetfocus.sh to ~/.config/polybar/scripts and everything should work nicely

#It was tested on i3gaps, if you want less processor usage just change the interval parameter to a higher value

#Hope you have fun with this!
